# MKS22X-FinalProject

DevLog:
Monday, May 20:
Elias Ferguson: I began to experiment with getting the Processing screen to display data from the webcam. Vishwaa ultimately achieved this first, and what I did was reverse the displayed image to make it mirror exactly. I created a new branch to begin work on the capture of a photo.

Tuesday, May 21:
Elias Ferguson: Starting to mess with ControlP5, specifically trying to make a Bang to take a picture.

Wednesday, May 22:
Elias Ferguson: Got the program to save the current image to the Sketch file, but the camera stops after one photo.

Thursday, May 22:
Elias Ferguson: Taking pictures now fully works. The camera only shutters for a brief second, and the photos are saved to a new directory that is inside Sketch, called PhotoBoothPhotos. Merging with the master branch.
