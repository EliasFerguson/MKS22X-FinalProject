# MKS22X-FinalProject

<b> DevLog: </b>

Monday, May 20: <br>
Elias Ferguson: I began to experiment with getting the Processing screen to display data from the webcam. Vishwaa ultimately achieved this first, and what I did was reverse the displayed image to make it mirror exactly. I created a new branch to begin work on the capture of a photo. <br>
Vishwaa Sofat: Created the display and setup such that the camera image could be displayed on the screen. Then worked with Elias to make the reverese function that displays image correctly.

Tuesday, May 21: <br>
Elias Ferguson: Starting to mess with ControlP5, specifically trying to make a Bang to take a picture. <br>
Vishwaa Sofat: Created the first filter: grayscale. Was not able to figure out how to display the updated picture but began debugging. Started writing code for the edgeDetect filter in the meantime. <br>

Wednesday, May 22:
Elias Ferguson: Got the program to save the current image to the Sketch file, but the camera stops after one photo.

Thursday, May 22:
Elias Ferguson: Taking pictures now fully works. The camera only shutters for a brief second, and the photos are saved to a new directory that is inside Sketch, called PhotoBoothPhotos. Merging with the master branch.

Friday, May 23:
Elias Ferguson: I am starting with more controlP5 to give the user more autonomy and ability to edit photos. The primary concern is the interface right now, and any buttons that go along with it. I started shaping the screen to display 8 previews, each with a different filter.

Monday, May 27:
Elias Ferguson: I finished the previews, WITHOUT the filters applied. That, however, is the easy part. I merged with the master branch successfully and now the master fully works with a slightly updated user interface.
