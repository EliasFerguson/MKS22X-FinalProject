DevLog:
Monday, May 20:
Elias Ferguson: I began to experiment with getting the Processing screen to display data from the webcam. Vishwaa ultimately achieved this first, and what I did was reverse the displayed image to make it mirror exactly. I created a new branch to begin work on the capture of a photo.

Elias Ferguson: Starting to mess with ControlP5, specifically trying to make a Bang to take a picture.
